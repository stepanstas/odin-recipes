            <p>Potato pancakes are one of my favorite foods that bring up many wonderful memories of growing up in the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a>.
            Potato pancakes are very tasty and simple to make. They are made from raw shredded potatoes, egg, flour, garlic, and hot milk, and they are pan-fried in a fat your choice. 
            My recommendation is to use some kind of stable cooking fat with high smoke point such as butter/ghee, lard, tallow/suet, palm or coconut oil instead of the pro-inflammatory 
            vegetable oils.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the raw potatoes and shred them finely with a box grater.</li>
                <li>Transfer the grated potatoes to a colander and squeeze out the excess liquid they released.</li>
                <li>Put the squeezed potatoes in a bowl, pour hot milk over them. Add the flour, egg, pressed garlic, dried marjoram, and salt.</li>
                <li>Stir the potato batter into a semi-fluid consistency.</li>
                <li>Take a non-stick frying pan, put the cooking fat/oil in it (1-2 Tablespoons per pancake), and heat it up to medium heat.</li>
                <li>Mix the potato batter evenly before frying, scoop one ladleful and carefully place it in the middle of the preheated pan. Using a flat spoon, spread the dough into a Â¼ inch (5-6 mm) thick pancake about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter.</li>
                <li>Fry each potato pancake for about 2-3 minutes on both sides. Flip with a flat spatula once the edges start to turn golden.</li>
                <li>Stack up the finished potato pancakes on a plate. If you want to save calories and make the pancakes less fatty, line them with paper towels to soak up excess fat.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
